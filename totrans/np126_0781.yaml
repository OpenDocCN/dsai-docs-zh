    that takes masked values into account. Note that *strict* and *out* are in different
    position than in the method version. In order to maintain compatibility with the
    corresponding method, it is recommended that the optional arguments be treated
    as keyword only. At some point that may be mandatory.

    Default is False. Propagating the mask means that if a masked value appears in
    a row or column, the whole row or column is considered masked.

    was not used. In particular, it must have the right type, must be C-contiguous,
    and its dtype must be the dtype that would be returned for *dot(a,b)*. This is
    a performance feature. Therefore, if these conditions are not met, an exception
    is raised, instead of attempting to be flexible.
