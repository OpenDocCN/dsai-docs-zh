- en: Like the independent-sample t-test, Dunnett’s test [[1]](#r903271b9c72c-1) is
    used to make inferences about the means of distributions from which samples were
    drawn. However, when multiple t-tests are performed at a fixed significance level,
    the “family-wise error rate” - the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null
    hypothesis in at least one test - will exceed the significance level. Dunnett’s
    test is designed to perform multiple comparisons while controlling the family-wise
    error rate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dunnett’s test compares the means of multiple experimental groups against a
    single control group. Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference Test is another
    multiple-comparison test that controls the family-wise error rate, but [`tukey_hsd`](scipy.stats.tukey_hsd.html#scipy.stats.tukey_hsd
    "scipy.stats.tukey_hsd") performs *all* pairwise comparisons between groups. When
    pairwise comparisons between experimental groups are not needed, Dunnett’s test
    is preferable due to its higher power.
