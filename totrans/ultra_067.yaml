    is a database of Zalando's article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000
    examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale
    image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Fashion-MNIST is intended to serve
    as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking
    machine learning algorithms.

    is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of Zalando's article images, intended
    as a modern replacement for the original MNIST dataset. It serves as a benchmark
    for machine learning models in the context of image classification tasks. Unlike
    MNIST, which contains handwritten digits, Fashion-MNIST consists of 28x28-pixel
    images categorized into 10 fashion-related classes, such as T-shirt/top, trouser,
    and ankle boot.
