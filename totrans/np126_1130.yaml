- en: NumPy 1.19.4 is a quick release to revert the OpenBLAS library version. It was
    hoped that the 0.3.12 OpenBLAS version used in 1.19.3 would work around the Microsoft
    fmod bug, but problems in some docker environments turned up. Instead, 1.19.4
    will use the older library and run a sanity check on import, raising an error
    if the problem is detected. Microsoft is aware of the problem and has promised
    a fix, users should upgrade when it becomes available.
