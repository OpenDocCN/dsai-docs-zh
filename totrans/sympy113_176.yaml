- en: Here the definition of the rolling disc’s kinematics is formed from the contact
    point up, removing the need to introduce generalized speeds. Only 3 configuration
    and three speed variables are need to describe this system, along with the disc’s
    mass and radius, and the local gravity (note that mass will drop out).

- en: The kinematics are formed by a series of simple rotations. Each simple rotation
    creates a new frame, and the next rotation is defined by the new frame’s basis
    vectors. This example uses a 3-1-2 series of rotations, or Z, X, Y series of rotations.
    Angular velocity for this is defined using the second frame’s basis (the lean
    frame); it is for this reason that we defined intermediate frames, rather than
    using a body-three orientation.

- en: This is the translational kinematics. We create a point with no velocity in
    N; this is the contact point between the disc and ground. Next we form the position
    vector from the contact point to the disc’s center of mass. Finally we form the
    velocity and acceleration of the disc.

- en: This is a simple way to form the inertia dyadic. The inertia of the disc does
    not change within the lean frame as the disc rolls; this will make for simpler
    equations in the end.

- en: Creation of the force list; it is the gravitational force at the center of mass
    of the disc. Then we create the disc by assigning a Point to the center of mass
    attribute, a ReferenceFrame to the frame attribute, and mass and inertia. Then
    we form the body list.

    Specify inertial frame, supply generalized coordinates and speeds, supply kinematic
    differential equation dictionary, compute Fr from the force list and Fr* from
    the body list, compute the mass matrix and forcing terms, then solve for the u
    dots (time derivatives of the generalized speeds).
