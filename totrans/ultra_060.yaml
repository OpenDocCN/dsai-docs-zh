    pose detection dataset composed of the first 8 images of the COCO train 2017 set,
    4 for training and 4 for validation. This dataset is ideal for testing and debugging
    object detection models, or for experimenting with new detection approaches. With
    8 images, it is small enough to be easily manageable, yet diverse enough to test
    training pipelines for errors and act as a sanity check before training larger
    datasets.'

    dataset?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mosaicing, demonstrated in the sample images of the COCO8-Pose dataset, combines
    multiple images into one, increasing the variety of objects and scenes within
    each training batch. This technique helps improve the model's ability to generalize
    across various object sizes, aspect ratios, and contexts, ultimately enhancing
    model performance. See the Sample Images and Annotations section for example images.
