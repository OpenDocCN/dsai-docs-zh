    of Differential equations and Abstract algebra.

- en: Holonomic function is a very general type of special function that includes
    lots of simple known functions as its special cases. In fact the more known hypergeometric
    function and Meijer G-function are also a special case of it.

- en: A function is called holonomic if it’s a solution to an ordinary differential
    equation having polynomial coefficients only. Since the general solution of a
    differential equation consists of a family of functions rather than a single function,
    holonomic functions are usually defined by a set of initial conditions along with
    the differential equation.

- en: Let \(K\) be a field of characteristic `0`. For example, \(K\) can be `QQ` or
    `RR`. A function \(f(x)\) will be holonomic if there exists polynomials \(p_0,
    p_1, p_2, ... p_r \in K[x]\) such that

    f^{(r)}(x) = 0\]

    of the function.

    = \sin(x): L = D^2 + 1,\: f(0) = 0, f''(0) = 1\end{aligned}\end{align} \]'

- en: Other fundamental functions such as \(\cos(x)\), \(\log(x)\), bessel functions
    etc. are also holonomic.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The family of holonomic functions is closed under addition, multiplication,
    integration, composition. This means if two functions are given are holonomic,
    then the function resulting on applying these operation on them will also be holonomic.
