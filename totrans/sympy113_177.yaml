- en: We will now revisit the rolling disc example, except this time we are bringing
    the non-contributing (constraint) forces into evidence. See [[Kane1985]](../reference.html#kane1985)
    for a more thorough explanation of this. Here, we will turn on the automatic simplifcation
    done when doing vector operations. It makes the outputs nicer for small problems,
    but can cause larger vector operations to hang.

- en: The definition of rolling without slip necessitates that the velocity of the
    contact point is zero; as part of bringing the constraint forces into evidence,
    we have to introduce speeds at this point, which will by definition always be
    zero. They are normal to the ground, along the path which the disc is rolling,
    and along the ground in a perpendicular direction.

- en: Just as we previously introduced three speeds as part of this process, we also
    introduce three forces; they are in the same direction as the speeds, and represent
    the constraint forces in those directions.
