    programming language. If you do not, the [official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
    is excellent.

- en: This tutorial assumes a decent mathematical background. Most examples require
    knowledge lower than a calculus level, and some require knowledge at a calculus
    level. Some of the advanced features require more than this. If you come across
    a section that uses some mathematical function you are not familiar with, you
    can probably skip over it, or replace it with a similar one that you are more
    familiar with. Or look up the function on Wikipedia and learn something new. Some
    important mathematical concepts that are not common knowledge will be introduced
    as necessary.

- en: This tutorial was the basis for a tutorial given at the 2013 SciPy conference
    in Austin, TX. The website for that tutorial is [here](https://certik.github.io/scipy-2013-tutorial/html/index.html).
    It has links to videos, materials, and IPython notebook exercises. The IPython
    notebook exercises in particular are recommended to anyone going through this
    tutorial.
