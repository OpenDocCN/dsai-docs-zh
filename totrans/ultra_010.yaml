  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Detection is the primary task supported by YOLOv8\. It involves detecting objects
    in an image or video frame and drawing bounding boxes around them. The detected
    objects are classified into different categories based on their features. YOLOv8
    can detect multiple objects in a single image or video frame with high accuracy
    and speed.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Segmentation is a task that involves segmenting an image into different regions
    based on the content of the image. Each region is assigned a label based on its
    content. This task is useful in applications such as image segmentation and medical
    imaging. YOLOv8 uses a variant of the U-Net architecture to perform segmentation.
