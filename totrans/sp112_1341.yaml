    converted to `np.ndarray` before the calculation is performed. In this case, the
    output will be a scalar or `np.ndarray` of appropriate shape rather than a 2D
    `np.matrix`. Similarly, while masked elements of masked arrays are ignored, the
    output will be a scalar or `np.ndarray` rather than a masked array with `mask=False`.
