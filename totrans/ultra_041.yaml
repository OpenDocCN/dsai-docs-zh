- en: The [Global Wheat Head Dataset](https://www.global-wheat.com/) is a collection
    of images designed to support the development of accurate wheat head detection
    models for applications in wheat phenotyping and crop management. Wheat heads,
    also known as spikes, are the grain-bearing parts of the wheat plant. Accurate
    estimation of wheat head density and size is essential for assessing crop health,
    maturity, and yield potential. The dataset, created by a collaboration of nine
    research institutes from seven countries, covers multiple growing regions to ensure
    models generalize well across different environments.
