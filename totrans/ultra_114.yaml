    on a highway. The core issue is that current speed monitoring methods are inefficient
    and error-prone due to outdated radar systems and manual processes. The project
    aims to develop a real-time computer vision system that can replace legacy [speed

    solve your issue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if your problem is monitoring vehicle speeds on a highway, the
    relevant computer vision task is object tracking. Object tracking is suitable
    because it allows the system to continuously follow each vehicle in the video
    feed, which is crucial for accurately calculating their speeds.

    location or movement information. Once you've identified the appropriate computer
    vision task, it guides several critical aspects of your project, like model selection,
    dataset preparation, and model training approaches.

    learn patterns from massive datasets, and during custom training (fine-tuning),
    these patterns are adjusted for your specific task. The model's capacity is limited,
    and focusing on new information can overwrite some previous learnings.

    is to use two models: one retains the original performance, and the other is fine-tuned
    for your specific task. This way, you can combine the outputs of both models.
    There are other options like freezing layers, using the pre-trained model as a
    feature extractor, and task-specific branching, but these are more complex solutions
    and require more expertise.'
