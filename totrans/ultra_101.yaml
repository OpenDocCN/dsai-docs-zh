    designed to help organizations move their workloads to the cloud from on-premises
    data centers. With the full spectrum of cloud services including those for computing,
    databases, analytics, machine learning, and networking, users can pick and choose
    from these services to develop and scale new applications, or run existing applications,

- en: Azure Machine Learning, commonly referred to as AzureML, is a fully managed
    cloud service that enables data scientists and developers to efficiently embed
    predictive analytics into their applications, helping organizations use massive
    data sets and bring all the benefits of the cloud to machine learning. AzureML
    offers a variety of services and capabilities aimed at making machine learning
    accessible, easy to use, and scalable. It provides capabilities like automated
    machine learning, drag-and-drop model training, as well as a robust Python SDK
    so that developers can make the most out of their machine learning models.
