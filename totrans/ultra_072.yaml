- en: The [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) (Modified National Institute
    of Standards and Technology) dataset is a large database of handwritten digits
    that is commonly used for training various image processing systems and machine
    learning models. It was created by "re-mixing" the samples from NIST's original
    datasets and has become a benchmark for evaluating the performance of image classification
    algorithms.

- en: Extended MNIST (EMNIST) is a newer dataset developed and released by NIST to
    be the successor to MNIST. While MNIST included images only of handwritten digits,
    EMNIST includes all the images from NIST Special Database 19, which is a large
    database of handwritten uppercase and lowercase letters as well as digits. The
    images in EMNIST were converted into the same 28x28 pixel format, by the same
    process, as were the MNIST images. Accordingly, tools that work with the older,
    smaller MNIST dataset will likely work unmodified with EMNIST.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset, or Modified National
    Institute of Standards and Technology dataset, is a widely-used collection of
    handwritten digits designed for training and testing image classification systems.
    It includes 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, all of which are
    grayscale and 28x28 pixels in size. The dataset's importance lies in its role
    as a standard benchmark for evaluating image classification algorithms, helping
    researchers and engineers to compare methods and track progress in the field.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The MNIST dataset contains only handwritten digits, whereas the Extended MNIST
    (EMNIST) dataset includes both digits and uppercase and lowercase letters. EMNIST
    was developed as a successor to MNIST and utilizes the same 28x28 pixel format
    for the images, making it compatible with tools and models designed for the original
    MNIST dataset. This broader range of characters in EMNIST makes it useful for
    a wider variety of machine learning applications.
