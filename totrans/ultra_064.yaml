- en: The [Caltech-256](https://data.caltech.edu/records/nyy15-4j048) dataset is an
    extensive collection of images used for object classification tasks. It contains
    around 30,000 images divided into 257 categories (256 object categories and 1
    background category). The images are carefully curated and annotated to provide
    a challenging and diverse benchmark for object recognition algorithms.
