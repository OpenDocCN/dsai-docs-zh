- en: Training a precise object detection model with oriented bounding boxes (OBB)
    requires a thorough dataset. This guide explains the various OBB dataset formats
    compatible with Ultralytics YOLO models, offering insights into their structure,
    application, and methods for format conversions.

- en: What are Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB) and how are they used in Ultralytics
    YOLO models?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB) are a type of bounding box annotation where the
    box can be rotated to align more closely with the object being detected, rather
    than just being axis-aligned. This is particularly useful in aerial or satellite
    imagery where objects might not be aligned with the image axes. In Ultralytics
    YOLO models, OBBs are represented by their four corner points in the YOLO OBB
    format. This allows for more accurate object detection since the bounding boxes
    can rotate to fit the objects better.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes, you can use your own dataset with oriented bounding boxes for YOLOv8 training.
    Ensure your dataset annotations are converted to the YOLO OBB format, which involves
    defining bounding boxes by their four corner points. You can then create a YAML
    configuration file specifying the dataset paths, classes, and other necessary
    details. For more information on creating and configuring your datasets, refer
    to the Supported Datasets section.
