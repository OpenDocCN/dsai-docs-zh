- en: Here the rolling disc is formed from the contact point up, removing the need
    to introduce generalized speeds. Only 3 configuration and 3 speed variables are
    needed to describe this system, along with the disc’s mass and radius, and the
    local gravity.

- en: The kinematics are formed by a series of simple rotations. Each simple rotation
    creates a new frame, and the next rotation is defined by the new frame’s basis
    vectors. This example uses a 3-1-2 series of rotations, or Z, X, Y series of rotations.
    Angular velocity for this is defined using the second frame’s basis (the lean
    frame).

    N; this is the contact point between the disc and ground. Next we form the position
    vector from the contact point to the disc’s center of mass. Finally we form the
    velocity and acceleration of the disc.

    object. Finally we solve for the generalized accelerations(q double dots) with
    the `rhs` method.
