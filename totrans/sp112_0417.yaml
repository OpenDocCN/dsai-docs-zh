- en: If *we* is a scalar, then that value is used for all data points (and all dimensions
    of the response variable). If *we* is a rank-1 array of length q (the dimensionality
    of the response variable), then this vector is the diagonal of the covariant weighting
    matrix for all data points. If *we* is a rank-1 array of length n (the number
    of data points), then the i’th element is the weight for the i’th response variable
    observation (single-dimensional only). If *we* is a rank-2 array of shape (q,
    q), then this is the full covariant weighting matrix broadcast to each observation.
    If *we* is a rank-2 array of shape (q, n), then *we[:,i]* is the diagonal of the
    covariant weighting matrix for the i’th observation. If *we* is a rank-3 array
    of shape (q, q, n), then *we[:,:,i]* is the full specification of the covariant
    weighting matrix for each observation. If the fit is implicit, then only a positive
    scalar value is used.

- en: If *wd* is a scalar, then that value is used for all data points (and all dimensions
    of the input variable). If *wd* = 0, then the covariant weighting matrix for each
    observation is set to the identity matrix (so each dimension of each observation
    has the same weight). If *wd* is a rank-1 array of length m (the dimensionality
    of the input variable), then this vector is the diagonal of the covariant weighting
    matrix for all data points. If *wd* is a rank-1 array of length n (the number
    of data points), then the i’th element is the weight for the ith input variable
    observation (single-dimensional only). If *wd* is a rank-2 array of shape (m,
    m), then this is the full covariant weighting matrix broadcast to each observation.
    If *wd* is a rank-2 array of shape (m, n), then *wd[:,i]* is the diagonal of the
    covariant weighting matrix for the ith observation. If *wd* is a rank-3 array
    of shape (m, m, n), then *wd[:,:,i]* is the full specification of the covariant
    weighting matrix for each observation.

- en: The *fix* argument is the same as ifixx in the class ODR. It is an array of
    integers with the same shape as data.x that determines which input observations
    are treated as fixed. One can use a sequence of length m (the dimensionality of
    the input observations) to fix some dimensions for all observations. A value of
    0 fixes the observation, a value > 0 makes it free.

- en: Each argument is attached to the member of the instance of the same name. The
    structures of *x* and *y* are described in the Model class docstring. If *y* is
    an integer, then the Data instance can only be used to fit with implicit models
    where the dimensionality of the response is equal to the specified value of *y*.

- en: The *we* argument weights the effect a deviation in the response variable has
    on the fit. The *wd* argument weights the effect a deviation in the input variable
    has on the fit. To handle multidimensional inputs and responses easily, the structure
    of these arguments has the n’th dimensional axis first. These arguments heavily
    use the structured arguments feature of ODRPACK to conveniently and flexibly support
    all options. See the ODRPACK User’s Guide for a full explanation of how these
    weights are used in the algorithm. Basically, a higher value of the weight for
    a particular data point makes a deviation at that point more detrimental to the
    fit.
