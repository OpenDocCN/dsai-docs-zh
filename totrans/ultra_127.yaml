- en: Setting up a high-performance deep learning environment can be daunting for
    newcomers, but fear not! üõ†Ô∏è With this guide, we'll walk you through the process
    of getting YOLOv5 up and running on an AWS Deep Learning instance. By leveraging
    the power of Amazon Web Services (AWS), even those new to machine learning can
    get started quickly and cost-effectively. The AWS platform's scalability is perfect
    for both experimentation and production deployment.

- en: For deep learning tasks, selecting a GPU instance type is generally recommended
    as it can vastly accelerate model training. For instance size considerations,
    remember that the model's memory requirements should never exceed what your instance
    can provide.

    If your model exceeds an instance''s available RAM, select a different instance
