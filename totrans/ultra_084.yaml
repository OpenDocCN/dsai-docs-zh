    Ultralytics YOLOv8?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To reduce false positives, ensure your Ultralytics YOLOv8 model is adequately
    trained with a diverse and well-annotated dataset. Fine-tuning hyperparameters
    and regularly updating the model with new data can significantly improve detection
    accuracy. Detailed hyperparameter tuning techniques can be found in our hyperparameter
    tuning guide.
