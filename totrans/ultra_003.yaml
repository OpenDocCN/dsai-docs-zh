  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Train mode is used for training a YOLOv8 model on a custom dataset. In this
    mode, the model is trained using the specified dataset and hyperparameters. The
    training process involves optimizing the model's parameters so that it can accurately
    predict the classes and locations of objects in an image.

- en: Val mode is used for validating a YOLOv8 model after it has been trained. In
    this mode, the model is evaluated on a validation set to measure its accuracy
    and generalization performance. This mode can be used to tune the hyperparameters
    of the model to improve its performance.

- en: Predict mode is used for making predictions using a trained YOLOv8 model on
    new images or videos. In this mode, the model is loaded from a checkpoint file,
    and the user can provide images or videos to perform inference. The model predicts
    the classes and locations of objects in the input images or videos.

    for deployment. In this mode, the model is converted to a format that can be used
    by other software applications or hardware devices. This mode is useful when deploying
    the model to production environments.

    this mode, the model is loaded from a checkpoint file, and the user can provide
    a live video stream to perform real-time object tracking. This mode is useful
    for applications such as surveillance systems or self-driving cars.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Benchmark mode is used to profile the speed and accuracy of various export formats
    for YOLOv8\. The benchmarks provide information on the size of the exported format,
    its `mAP50-95` metrics (for object detection, segmentation and pose) or `accuracy_top5`
    metrics (for classification), and the inference time in milliseconds per image
    across various export formats like ONNX, OpenVINO, TensorRT and others. This information
    can help users choose the optimal export format for their specific use case based
    on their requirements for speed and accuracy.
