- en: The [SKU-110k](https://github.com/eg4000/SKU110K_CVPR19) dataset is a collection
    of densely packed retail shelf images, designed to support research in object
    detection tasks. Developed by Eran Goldman et al., the dataset contains over 110,000
    unique store keeping unit (SKU) categories with densely packed objects, often
    looking similar or even identical, positioned in close proximity.
