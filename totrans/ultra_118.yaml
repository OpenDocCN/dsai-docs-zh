    perform optimally is essential. Just training your model isn't enough. You need
    to make sure that your model is accurate, efficient, and fulfills the objective
    of your computer vision project. By evaluating and fine-tuning your model, you
    can identify weaknesses, improve its accuracy, and boost overall performance.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Evaluating how well a model performs helps us understand how effectively it
    works. Various metrics are used to measure performance. These performance metrics
    provide clear, numerical insights that can guide improvements toward making sure
    the model meets its intended goals. Let's take a closer look at a few key metrics.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The confidence score represents the model's certainty that a detected object
    belongs to a particular class. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating
    greater confidence. The confidence score helps filter predictions; only detections
    with confidence scores above a specified threshold are considered valid.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Quick Tip:* When running inferences, if you aren''t seeing any predictions
    and you''ve checked everything else, try lowering the confidence score. Sometimes,
    the threshold is too high, causing the model to ignore valid predictions. Lowering
    the score allows the model to consider more possibilities. This might not meet
    your project goals, but it''s a good way to see what the model can do and decide
    how to fine-tune it.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Intersection over Union (IoU) is a metric in object detection that measures
    how well the predicted bounding box overlaps with the ground truth bounding box.
    IoU values range from 0 to 1, where one stands for a perfect match. IoU is essential
    because it measures how closely the predicted boundaries match the actual object
    boundaries.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mean Average Precision (mAP) is a way to measure how well an object detection
    model performs. It looks at the precision of detecting each object class, averages
    these scores, and gives an overall number that shows how accurately the model
    can identify and classify objects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Let''s focus on two specific mAP metrics:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*mAP@.5:* Measures the average precision at a single IoU (Intersection over
    Union) threshold of 0.5\. This metric checks if the model can correctly find objects
    with a looser accuracy requirement. It focuses on whether the object is roughly
    in the right place, not needing perfect placement. It helps see if the model is
    generally good at spotting objects.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*mAP@.5:.95:* Averages the mAP values calculated at multiple IoU thresholds,
    from 0.5 to 0.95 in 0.05 increments. This metric is more detailed and strict.
    It gives a fuller picture of how accurately the model can find objects at different
    levels of strictness and is especially useful for applications that need precise
    object detection.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other mAP metrics include mAP@0.75, which uses a stricter IoU threshold of 0.75,
    and mAP@small, medium, and large, which evaluate precision across objects of different
    sizes.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Evaluating your YOLOv8 model with images of different sizes can help you understand
    its performance on diverse datasets. Using the `rect=true` validation parameter,
    YOLOv8 adjusts the network's stride for each batch based on the image sizes, allowing
    the model to handle rectangular images without forcing them to a single size.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `imgsz` validation parameter sets the maximum dimension for image resizing,
    which is 640 by default. You can adjust this based on your dataset's maximum dimensions
    and the GPU memory available. Even with `imgsz` set, `rect=true` lets the model
    manage varying image sizes effectively by dynamically adjusting the stride.

    to improve performance on a specific task or dataset. The process, also known

- en: Starting With a Higher Learning Rate
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Usually, during the initial training epochs, the learning rate starts low and
    gradually increases to stabilize the training process. However, since your model
    has already learned some features from the previous dataset, starting with a higher
    learning rate right away can be more beneficial.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When evaluating your YOLOv8 model, you can set the `warmup_epochs` validation
    parameter to `warmup_epochs=0` to prevent the learning rate from starting too
    high. By following this process, the training will continue from the provided
    weights, adjusting to the nuances of your new data.

- en: Image tiling can improve detection accuracy for small objects. By dividing larger
    images into smaller segments, such as splitting 1280x1280 images into multiple
    640x640 segments, you maintain the original resolution, and the model can learn
    from high-resolution fragments. When using YOLOv8, make sure to adjust your labels
    for these new segments correctly.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To evaluate YOLOv8 model performance, important metrics include Confidence Score,
    Intersection over Union (IoU), and Mean Average Precision (mAP). Confidence Score
    measures the model's certainty for each detected object class. IoU evaluates how
    well the predicted bounding box overlaps with the ground truth. Mean Average Precision
    (mAP) aggregates precision scores across classes, with mAP@.5 and mAP@.5:.95 being
    two common types for varying IoU thresholds. Learn more about these metrics in
    our YOLOv8 performance metrics guide.
