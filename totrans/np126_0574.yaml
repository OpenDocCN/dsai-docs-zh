  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If *a* is 2-D, the sum along its diagonal with the given offset is returned,
    i.e., the sum of elements `a[i,i+offset]` for all i.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If *a* has more than two dimensions, then the axes specified by axis1 and axis2
    are used to determine the 2-D sub-arrays whose traces are returned. The shape
    of the resulting array is the same as that of *a* with *axis1* and *axis2* removed.

    the elements are summed. If dtype has the value None and *a* is of integer type
    of precision less than the default integer precision, then the default integer
    precision is used. Otherwise, the precision is the same as that of *a*.
