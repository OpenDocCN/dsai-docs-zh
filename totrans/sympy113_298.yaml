    you to be one of them too! Getting started in a well-oiled large and complex machine
    like SymPy can be daunting for new contributors. This page exists to give tips
    for new contributors to get started.

    will help you to familiarize yourself with the uses of SymPy.

    is one place where discussions about SymPy happen. You can ask questions about
    how to use SymPy, discuss feature requests, discuss software bugs, or share how
    you are using SymPy. Request to join the list on the Google Groups page. Note
    that to prevent spam, the first time you post your message will need to be moderated
    before it is posted to the list. Please read [http://shakthimaan.com/downloads/book/chapter1.pdf](http://shakthimaan.com/downloads/book/chapter1.pdf)
    before posting to get familiar with mailing list etiquette.

    [changes over time](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/commits/master) and to effectively
    manage [contributions from many different authors](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/network).
    We also utilize GitHub, a web interface to Git, extensively and use it for communication,
    issue tracking, merging contributions (i.e., pull requests), etc.

    page first for instructions on how to set up your development environment. If
    you are already familiar with the basic GitHub workflow, the [Development Workflow
    Process](new-contributors-guide/workflow-process.html#workflow-process) page describes
    the aspects of the GitHub contribution workflow that are specific to SymPy.

    fixing software bugs and adding new features for things that are interesting to
    them. But there are other things we need help with too, like maintaining our websites,
    writing documentation, preparing tutorials, answering people’s questions on the
    mailing lists, chat room, StackOverflow, and issue tracker, and reviewing pull
    requests. Here are some following ways to get started with a contribution:'

- en: The best way to start with the main codebase is to fix some existing bugs. If
    you are looking for a bug to fix, you can start by looking at the issues labeled
    [“Easy to fix”](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Easy+to+Fix%22)
    in the issue tracker and see if one interests you. If it isn’t clear how to fix
    it, ask for suggestions on how to do it in the issue itself or on the mailing
    list.

    in the `sympy/core` directory and other packages in the `sympy` directory have
    more specific code, for example `sympy/printing` handles how SymPy objects are
    printed to the terminal and Jupyter.

    you have gained some familiarity with a part of the SymPy codebase and the SymPy
    development processes, it can be helpful to the community to review others’ pull
    requests. You can view the code submission and check whether it does what it is
    intended to do.
