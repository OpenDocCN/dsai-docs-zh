- en: The elements of *a* are read using this index order. ‘C’ means to index the
    elements in C-like order, with the last axis index changing fastest, back to the
    first axis index changing slowest. ‘F’ means to index the elements in Fortran-like
    index order, with the first index changing fastest, and the last index changing
    slowest. Note that the ‘C’ and ‘F’ options take no account of the memory layout
    of the underlying array, and only refer to the order of axis indexing. ‘A’ means
    to read the elements in Fortran-like index order if *m* is Fortran *contiguous*
    in memory, C-like order otherwise. ‘K’ means to read the elements in the order
    they occur in memory, except for reversing the data when strides are negative.
    By default, ‘C’ index order is used. (Masked arrays currently use ‘A’ on the data
    when ‘K’ is passed.)
