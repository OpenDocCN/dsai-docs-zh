    numpy` and examining the docstrings, you will need to first [build](development_environment.html#development-environment)
    and install it so that the correct version is imported. NumPy has to be re-built
    and re-installed every time you fetch the latest version of the repository, before
    generating the documentation. This ensures that the NumPy version and the git
    repository version are in sync.

    (via e.g. `conda`, `virtualenv` or the `venv` module), installing NumPy into a
    new virtual environment is recommended.
