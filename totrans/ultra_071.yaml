- en: The [ImageWoof](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette) dataset is a subset of
    the ImageNet consisting of 10 classes that are challenging to classify, since
    they're all dog breeds. It was created as a more difficult task for image classification
    algorithms to solve, aiming at encouraging development of more advanced models.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Noisy labels in the ImageWoof dataset simulate real-world conditions where labels
    might not always be accurate. Training models with this data helps develop robustness
    and generalization in image classification tasks. This prepares the models to
    handle ambiguous or mislabeled data effectively, which is often encountered in
    practical applications.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The primary challenge of the ImageWoof dataset lies in the subtle differences
    among the dog breeds it includes. Since it focuses on 10 closely related breeds,
    distinguishing between them requires more advanced and fine-tuned image classification
    models. This makes ImageWoof an excellent benchmark to test the capabilities and
    improvements of deep learning models.
