    of [contributors](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/graphs/contributors) and
    a smaller group of [maintainers](https://pandas.pydata.org/about/team.html). The
    pandas leadership has made a strong commitment to creating an open, inclusive,
    and positive community. Please read the pandas [Code of Conduct](https://pandas.pydata.org/community/coc.html)
    for guidance on how to interact with others in a way that makes the community
    thrive.
