- en: These Boolean-valued flags affect how numpy interprets the memory area used
    by *a* (see Notes below). The ALIGNED flag can only be set to True if the data
    is actually aligned according to the type. The WRITEBACKIFCOPY and flag can never
    be set to True. The flag WRITEABLE can only be set to True if the array owns its
    own memory, or the ultimate owner of the memory exposes a writeable buffer interface,
    or is a string. (The exception for string is made so that unpickling can be done
    without copying memory.)
