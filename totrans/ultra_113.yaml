    seeing what data you are able to collect in Step 2\. For example, suppose your
    project is highly dependent on the availability of specific types of data. In
    that case, it may be more practical to gather and analyze the data first before
    selecting a model. On the other hand, if you have a clear understanding of the
    model requirements, you can choose the model first and then collect data that
    fits those specifications.

    you prepare your data. Training from scratch requires a diverse dataset to build
    the model's understanding from the ground up. Transfer learning, on the other
    hand, allows you to use a pre-trained model and adapt it with a smaller, more
    specific dataset. Also, choosing a specific model to train will determine how
    you need to prepare your data, such as resizing images or adding annotations,
    according to the model's specific requirements.
