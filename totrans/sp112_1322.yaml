- en: Suppose that a gardener wishes to test the number of dodder (weed) seeds in
    a sack of clover seeds that they buy from a seed company. It has previously been
    established that the number of dodder seeds in clover follows the Poisson distribution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A 100 gram sample is drawn from the sack before being shipped to the gardener.
    The sample is analyzed, and it is found to contain no dodder seeds; that is, *k1*
    is 0\. However, upon arrival, the gardener draws another 100 gram sample from
    the sack. This time, three dodder seeds are found in the sample; that is, *k2*
    is 3\. The gardener would like to know if the difference is significant and not
    due to chance. The null hypothesis is that the difference between the two samples
    is merely due to chance, or that \(\lambda_1 - \lambda_2 = \mathtt{diff}\) where
    \(\mathtt{diff} = 0\). The alternative hypothesis is that the difference is not
    due to chance, or \(\lambda_1 - \lambda_2 \ne 0\). The gardener selects a significance
    level of 5% to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative [[2]](#r48657b251c79-2).

- en: The p-value is .088, indicating a near 9% chance of observing a value of the
    test statistic under the null hypothesis. This exceeds 5%, so the gardener does
    not reject the null hypothesis as the difference cannot be regarded as significant
    at this level.
