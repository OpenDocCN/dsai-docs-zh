- en: The shape property is usually used to get the current shape of an array, but
    may also be used to reshape the array in-place by assigning a tuple of array dimensions
    to it. As with [`numpy.reshape`](numpy.reshape.html#numpy.reshape "numpy.reshape"),
    one of the new shape dimensions can be -1, in which case its value is inferred
    from the size of the array and the remaining dimensions. Reshaping an array in-place
    will fail if a copy is required.
