attribute

```py
ndarray.shape
```

Tuple of array dimensions.

The shape property is usually used to get the current shape of an array, but may also be used to reshape the array in-place by assigning a tuple of array dimensions to it. As with `numpy.reshape`, one of the new shape dimensions can be -1, in which case its value is inferred from the size of the array and the remaining dimensions. Reshaping an array in-place will fail if a copy is required.

Warning

Setting `arr.shape` is discouraged and may be deprecated in the future. Using `ndarray.reshape` is the preferred approach.

Examples

```py
>>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
>>> x.shape
(4,)
>>> y = np.zeros((2, 3, 4))
>>> y.shape
(2, 3, 4)
>>> y.shape = (3, 8)
>>> y
array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
 [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],
 [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.]])
>>> y.shape = (3, 6)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: total size of new array must be unchanged
>>> np.zeros((4,2))[::2].shape = (-1,)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: Incompatible shape for in-place modification. Use
`.reshape()` to make a copy with the desired shape.
