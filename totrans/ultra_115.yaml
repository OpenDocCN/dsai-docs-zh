- en: The key to success in any computer vision project starts with effective data
    collection and annotation strategies. The quality of the data directly impacts
    model performance, so it's important to understand the best practices related
    to data collection and data annotation.
  prefs: []

    goals. Changes in your annotation strategies could shift the project's focus or
    effectiveness and vice versa. With this in mind, let's take a closer look at the
    best ways to approach data collection and annotation.

- en: Choosing the Right Classes for Your Project
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the first questions when starting a computer vision project is how many
    classes to include. You need to determine the class membership, which is involves
    the different categories or labels that you want your model to recognize and differentiate.
    The number of classes should be determined by the specific goals of your project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if you want to monitor traffic, your classes might include "car,"
    "truck," "bus," "motorcycle," and "bicycle." On the other hand, for tracking items
    in a store, your classes could be "fruits," "vegetables," "beverages," and "snacks."
    Defining classes based on your project goals helps keep your dataset relevant
    and focused.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'When you define your classes, another important distinction to make is whether
    to choose coarse or fine class counts. ''Count'' refers to the number of distinct
    classes you are interested in. This decision influences the granularity of your
    data and the complexity of your model. Here are the considerations for each approach:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Coarse Class-Count**: These are broader, more inclusive categories, such
    as "vehicle" and "non-vehicle." They simplify annotation and require fewer computational
    resources but provide less detailed information, potentially limiting the model''s
    effectiveness in complex scenarios.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Fine Class-Count**: More categories with finer distinctions, such as "sedan,"
    "SUV," "pickup truck," and "motorcycle." They capture more detailed information,
    improving model accuracy and performance. However, they are more time-consuming
    and labor-intensive to annotate and require more computational resources.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Something to note is that starting with more specific classes can be very helpful,
    especially in complex projects where details are important. More specific classes
    lets you collect more detailed data, and gain deeper insights and clearer distinctions
    between categories. Not only does it improve the accuracy of the model, but it
    also makes it easier to adjust the model later if needed, saving both time and
    resources.

    data, making them great starting points for training and validating models.

    to your specific needs. You might capture images and videos with cameras or drones,
    scrape the web for images, or use existing internal data from your organization.
    Custom data gives you more control over its quality and relevance. Combining both
    public and custom data sources helps create a diverse and comprehensive dataset.

    machine learning models. In computer vision, this means labeling images or videos
    with the information that a model needs to learn from. Without properly annotated
    data, models cannot accurately learn the relationships between inputs and outputs.

    how it relates to annotation. Accuracy refers to how close the annotated data
    is to the true values. It helps us measure how closely the labels reflect real-world
    scenarios. Precision indicates the consistency of annotations. It checks if you
    are giving the same label to the same object or feature throughout the dataset.
    High accuracy and precision lead to better-trained models by reducing noise and
    improving the model's ability to generalize from the training data.

    with examples and illustrations to clarify expectations. Consistency is achieved
    by setting standard criteria for annotating various data types, ensuring all annotations
    follow the same rules. To reduce personal biases, train annotators to stay neutral
    and objective. Regular reviews and updates of labeling rules help maintain accuracy
    and alignment with project goals. Using automated tools to check for consistency
