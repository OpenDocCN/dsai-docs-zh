- en: The Physics Tutorials aim to introduce SymPy to users who have not previously
    used its physics features. The functionalities presented here have many more options
    and capabilities than what is covered in the tutorials. Through insightful examples
    and exercises, the tutorials demonstrate how to incorporate various physics subpackages
    of SymPy, including but not limited to multibody dynamics, quantum mechanics,
    optics, and continuum mechanics, to model and simulate different physical systems
    and their behaviors.
