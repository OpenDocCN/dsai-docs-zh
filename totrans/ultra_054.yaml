    instance segmentation dataset composed of the first 8 images of the COCO train
    2017 set, 4 for training and 4 for validation. This dataset is ideal for testing
    and debugging segmentation models, or for experimenting with new detection approaches.
    With 8 images, it is small enough to be easily manageable, yet diverse enough
    to test training pipelines for errors and act as a sanity check before training
    larger datasets.'

- en: The **COCO8-Seg dataset** is a compact instance segmentation dataset by Ultralytics,
    consisting of the first 8 images from the COCO train 2017 set—4 images for training
    and 4 for validation. This dataset is tailored for testing and debugging segmentation
    models or experimenting with new detection methods. It is particularly useful
    with Ultralytics [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) and [HUB](https://hub.ultralytics.com)
    for rapid iteration and pipeline error-checking before scaling to larger datasets.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The **COCO8-Seg dataset** is ideal for its manageability and diversity within
    a small size. It consists of only 8 images, providing a quick way to test and
    debug segmentation models or new detection approaches without the overhead of
    larger datasets. This makes it an efficient tool for sanity checks and pipeline
    error identification before committing to extensive training on large datasets.

    dataset?

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using **mosaicing** during training helps increase the diversity and variety
    of objects and scenes in each training batch. This technique combines multiple
    images into a single composite image, enhancing the model's ability to generalize
    to different object sizes, aspect ratios, and contexts within the scene. Mosaicing
    is beneficial for improving a model's robustness and accuracy, especially when
    working with small datasets like COCO8-Seg. For an example of mosaiced images,
    see the Sample Images and Annotations section.
