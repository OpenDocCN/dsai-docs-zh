  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Semantic search is a technique for finding similar images to a given image.
    It is based on the idea that similar images will have similar embeddings. In the
    UI, you can select one of more images and search for the images similar to them.
    This can be useful when you want to find images similar to a given image or a
    set of images that don't perform as expected.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The semantic search feature in Ultralytics Explorer GUI allows you to find images
    similar to a given image based on their embeddings. This technique is useful for
    identifying and exploring images that share visual similarities. To use this feature,
    select one or more images in the UI and execute a search for similar images. The
    result will display images that closely resemble the selected ones, facilitating
    efficient dataset exploration and anomaly detection.

    filter your datasets using natural language queries. You don't need to be proficient
    in SQL. For instance, you can ask "Show me 100 images with exactly one person
    and 2 dogs. There can be other objects too," and the AI will generate the appropriate
    query under the hood to deliver the desired results.
