It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provide additional examples and further outline details of the architecture and features of SymPy.\n             },\n     volume = 3,\n     pages = {e103},\n     journal = {PeerJ Computer Science},\n     issn = {2376-5992},\n     url = {https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.103},\n     doi = {10.7717/peerj-cs.103}\n    } \n```"]
