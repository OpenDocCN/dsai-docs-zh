- en: This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the SciPy project, including
    all public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis, blogs, Twitter, and
    any other communication channel used by our community. The SciPy project does
    not organize in-person events, however, events related to our community should
    have a code of conduct similar in spirit to this one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This code of conduct should be honored by everyone who participates in the SciPy
    community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with the project,
    in any project-related activities, and, especially, when representing the project,
    in any role.
  prefs: []

- en: This code is neither exhaustive nor complete. It serves to distill our common
    understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. Please try to
    follow this code in spirit as much as in letter, to create a friendly and productive
    environment that enriches the surrounding community.

- en: Be open. We invite anyone to participate in our community. We prefer to use
    public methods of communication for project-related messages, unless discussing
    something sensitive. This applies to messages for help or project-related support,
    too; not only is a public-support request much more likely to result in an answer
    to a question, it also ensures that any inadvertent mistakes in answering are
    more easily detected and corrected.
  prefs:

    conflict, and assume good intentions. We may all experience some frustration from
    time to time, but we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack.
    A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive
    one.
  prefs:

    depend on the work of others. When we make something for the benefit of the project,
    we are willing to explain to others how it works, so that they can build on the
    work to make it even better. Any decision we make will affect users and colleagues,
    and we take those consequences seriously when making decisions.
