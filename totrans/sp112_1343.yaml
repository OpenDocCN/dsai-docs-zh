- en: The Friedman test tests the null hypothesis that repeated samples of the same
    individuals have the same distribution. It is often used to test for consistency
    among samples obtained in different ways. For example, if two sampling techniques
    are used on the same set of individuals, the Friedman test can be used to determine
    if the two sampling techniques are consistent.

    the p-value is only reliable for n > 10 and more than 6 repeated samples.
