- en: The [Caltech-101](https://data.caltech.edu/records/mzrjq-6wc02) dataset is a
    widely used dataset for object recognition tasks, containing around 9,000 images
    from 101 object categories. The categories were chosen to reflect a variety of
    real-world objects, and the images themselves were carefully selected and annotated
    to provide a challenging benchmark for object recognition algorithms.

- en: Unlike many other datasets, the Caltech-101 dataset is not formally split into
    training and testing sets. Users typically create their own splits based on their
    specific needs. However, a common practice is to use a random subset of images
    for training (e.g., 30 images per category) and the remaining images for testing.
