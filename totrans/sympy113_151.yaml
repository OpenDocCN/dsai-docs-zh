- en: The factor is constructed from a base (default is 10) to some power, and it
    gives the total multiple or fraction. For example the kilometer km is constructed
    from the meter (factor 1) and the kilo (10 to the power 3, i.e. 1000). The base
    can be changed to allow e.g. binary prefixes.
