- en: What are the differences between YOLOv3, YOLOv3-Ultralytics, and YOLOv3u?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: YOLOv3 is the third iteration of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection
    algorithm developed by Joseph Redmon, known for its balance of accuracy and speed,
    utilizing three different scales (13x13, 26x26, and 52x52) for detections. YOLOv3-Ultralytics
    is Ultralytics' adaptation of YOLOv3 that adds support for more pre-trained models
    and facilitates easier model customization. YOLOv3u is an upgraded variant of
    YOLOv3-Ultralytics, integrating the anchor-free, objectness-free split head from
    YOLOv8, improving detection robustness and accuracy for various object sizes.
    For more details on the variants, refer to the [YOLOv3 series](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3).

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: YOLOv3u improves upon YOLOv3 and YOLOv3-Ultralytics by incorporating the anchor-free,
    objectness-free split head used in YOLOv8 models. This upgrade eliminates the
    need for pre-defined anchor boxes and objectness scores, enhancing its capability
    to detect objects of varying sizes and shapes more precisely. This makes YOLOv3u
    a better choice for complex and diverse object detection tasks. For more information,
    refer to the Why YOLOv3u section.
