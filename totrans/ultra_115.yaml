- en: The key to success in any computer vision project starts with effective data
    collection and annotation strategies. The quality of the data directly impacts
    model performance, so it's important to understand the best practices related
    to data collection and data annotation.

    goals. Changes in your annotation strategies could shift the project's focus or
    effectiveness and vice versa. With this in mind, let's take a closer look at the
    best ways to approach data collection and annotation.

  id: totrans-7
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the first questions when starting a computer vision project is how many
    classes to include. You need to determine the class membership, which is involves
    the different categories or labels that you want your model to recognize and differentiate.
    The number of classes should be determined by the specific goals of your project.
  id: totrans-8
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if you want to monitor traffic, your classes might include "car,"
    "truck," "bus," "motorcycle," and "bicycle." On the other hand, for tracking items
    in a store, your classes could be "fruits," "vegetables," "beverages," and "snacks."
    Defining classes based on your project goals helps keep your dataset relevant
    and focused.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'When you define your classes, another important distinction to make is whether
    to choose coarse or fine class counts. ''Count'' refers to the number of distinct
    classes you are interested in. This decision influences the granularity of your
    data and the complexity of your model. Here are the considerations for each approach:'
  id: totrans-10
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Coarse Class-Count**: These are broader, more inclusive categories, such
    as "vehicle" and "non-vehicle." They simplify annotation and require fewer computational
    resources but provide less detailed information, potentially limiting the model''s
    effectiveness in complex scenarios.'
  id: totrans-11
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Fine Class-Count**: More categories with finer distinctions, such as "sedan,"
    "SUV," "pickup truck," and "motorcycle." They capture more detailed information,
    improving model accuracy and performance. However, they are more time-consuming
    and labor-intensive to annotate and require more computational resources.'
  id: totrans-12
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Something to note is that starting with more specific classes can be very helpful,
    especially in complex projects where details are important. More specific classes
    lets you collect more detailed data, and gain deeper insights and clearer distinctions
    between categories. Not only does it improve the accuracy of the model, but it
    also makes it easier to adjust the model later if needed, saving both time and
    resources.

    machine learning models. In computer vision, this means labeling images or videos
    with the information that a model needs to learn from. Without properly annotated
