- en: Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test performs pairwise comparison
    of means for a set of samples. Whereas ANOVA (e.g. [`f_oneway`](scipy.stats.f_oneway.html#scipy.stats.f_oneway
    "scipy.stats.f_oneway")) assesses whether the true means underlying each sample
    are identical, Tukey’s HSD is a post hoc test used to compare the mean of each
    sample to the mean of each other sample.

- en: The null hypothesis is that the distributions underlying the samples all have
    the same mean. The test statistic, which is computed for every possible pairing
    of samples, is simply the difference between the sample means. For each pair,
    the p-value is the probability under the null hypothesis (and other assumptions;
    see notes) of observing such an extreme value of the statistic, considering that
    many pairwise comparisons are being performed. Confidence intervals for the difference
    between each pair of means are also available.

    between `group0` and `group1` as well as `group1` and `group2` do not exceed .05,
    so we reject the null hypothesis that they have the same means. The p-value of
    the comparison between `group0` and `group2` exceeds .05, so we accept the null
    hypothesis that there is not a significant difference between their means.
