- en: Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR), developed by Baidu, is a cutting-edge
    end-to-end object detector that provides real-time performance while maintaining
    high accuracy. It is based on the idea of DETR (the NMS-free framework), meanwhile
    introducing conv-based backbone and an efficient hybrid encoder to gain real-time
    speed. RT-DETR efficiently processes multiscale features by decoupling intra-scale
    interaction and cross-scale fusion. The model is highly adaptable, supporting
    flexible adjustment of inference speed using different decoder layers without
    retraining. RT-DETR excels on accelerated backends like CUDA with TensorRT, outperforming
    many other real-time object detectors.

    of Baidu''s RT-DETR.** The RT-DETR model architecture diagram shows the last three
    stages of the backbone {S3, S4, S5} as the input to the encoder. The efficient
    hybrid encoder transforms multiscale features into a sequence of image features
    through intrascale feature interaction (AIFI) and cross-scale feature-fusion module
    (CCFM). The IoU-aware query selection is employed to select a fixed number of
    image features to serve as initial object queries for the decoder. Finally, the
    decoder with auxiliary prediction heads iteratively optimizes object queries to
    generate boxes and confidence scores ([source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08069.pdf)).'
