- en: Currently, [`sympy.physics.control`](index.html#module-sympy.physics.control
    "sympy.physics.control") is able to deal with LTI (Linear, time-invariant) systems.
    The `TransferFunction` class is used to represent Continuous-time Transfer functions
    in the Laplace domain; where Transfer functions are input to output representations
    of dynamic systems. The additive property is used for transfer functions in the
    `Parallel` class, and the multiplicative property is used for transfer functions
    in the `Series` class. Also, there is a `Feedback` class which is used to represent
    negative feedback interconnection between two input/output systems. MIMO systems
    are also supported with `TransferFunctionMatrix` as the base class for representing
    one. `MIMOSeries`, `MIMOParallel` and `MIMOFeedback` are MIMO equivalent of `Series`,
    `Parallel` and `Feedback` classes.

- en: The advantage of this symbolic Control system package is that the solutions
    obtained from it are highly accurate and do not rely on numerical methods to approximate
    the solutions. Symbolic solutions obtained are also in a compact form that can
    be used for further analysis.
