- en: The SymPy CAS can be installed on virtually any computer with Python. SymPy
    does require [mpmath](https://mpmath.org/) Python library to be installed first.
    The recommended method of installation is through Anaconda, which includes mpmath,
    as well as several other useful libraries. Alternatively, some Linux distributions
    have SymPy packages available.

    distribution from Continuum Analytics that includes SymPy, Matplotlib, IPython,
    NumPy, and many more useful packages for scientific computing. This is recommended
    because many nice features of SymPy are only enabled when certain libraries are
    installed. For example, without Matplotlib, only simple text-based plotting is
    enabled. With the IPython notebook or qtconsole, you can get nicer \(\mathrm{\LaTeX}\)
    printing by running `init_printing()`.'
